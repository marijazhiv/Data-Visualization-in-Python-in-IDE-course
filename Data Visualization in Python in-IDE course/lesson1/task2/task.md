# Task 1: Install Required Libraries

In this task, you will set up your environment by creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`.

## Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install the required libraries.

**Commands**:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly 
```
Once created, we activate it to install libraries just for this project:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Libraries for Data Visualization
Here’s a quick overview of the three libraries we’ll use for data visualization:

**Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library that allows us to organize, filter, and analyze large datasets efficiently. It is commonly used to prepare and structure data before visualization.

**Matplotlib**: A flexible plotting library that provides a wide range of chart types and customization options. With Matplotlib, you can create line charts, bar charts, histograms, and more, with fine control over style and formatting.

**Plotly**: A modern library known for interactive and visually appealing plots. Plotly can produce interactive charts that allow users to hover over data points, zoom in on details, and save images easily. It is especially useful for creating dashboards and web applications.

### Why Use Python for Data Visualization?

- **Easy to Learn**: Python’s syntax is clean and beginner-friendly, making it accessible to those new to programming and data science.
- **Large Community and Resources**: Python has an extensive ecosystem with numerous libraries specifically built for data analysis and visualization, making it easier to find resources, tutorials, and support.
- **Integration with Data Science Tools**: Python works well with other data science tools, such as Jupyter notebooks, which allow users to combine code, text, and visualizations in an interactive document.

While Python is highly popular, **R** is also widely used in data visualization, particularly in academic and statistical research. Each language has strengths, but Python’s broad usage across industries and flexible libraries make it ideal for practical, large-scale data analysis projects.

## Fun Fact

> **Did you know?** Python wasn’t originally created for data science! It was intended to be a general-purpose language, but its versatility and ease of use quickly made it popular in data science. Today, Python is not only a staple in data science but is also used in fields like web development, automation, and artificial intelligence.
