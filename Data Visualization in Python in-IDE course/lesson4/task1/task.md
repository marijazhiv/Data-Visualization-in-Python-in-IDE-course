# Task 1: Plot a Basic Bar Chart

In this task, you will create a basic bar chart to display the number of games per genre across the platforms `PS4`, `XOne`, `PC`, and `WiiU`.

### Instructions
- Use the filtered dataset from the previous lesson.
- Group the data by genre and platform to count the number of games.
- Plot the bar chart showing genres on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis.

**Hint**: Use `groupby` with Pandas, then use `matplotlib.pyplot.bar`.
