# Data Visualization in Python - In-IDE Course

Welcome to the **Data Visualization in Python** course! This project is designed as an in-IDE, step-by-step guide to help students learn how to create and customize data visualizations using Python.

## Project Overview

This course consists of multiple lessons that guide students through creating a single bar chart showing the number of games across four specific gaming platforms (`PS4`, `XOne`, `PC`, and `WiiU`) categorized by genre. Students will learn to:

- Filter and manipulate data using Pandas
- Plot and customize bar charts using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly
- Structure visualizations to present clear, insightful data

Each lesson includes:
- Theory and coding tasks
- Test scripts to verify the correctness of each step
- Practical guidance on how to structure and set up each plot

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.9+
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly` (depending on your preferred visualization library)

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
